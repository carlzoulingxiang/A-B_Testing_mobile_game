<p>This project is based on a mini project from <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/projects/184">Datacamp</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/cookiecatsgame">Cookie Cats</a> is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by <a href="http://tactile.dk">Tactile Entertainment</a>. It's a classic "connect three"-style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color to clear the board and win the level. It also features singing cats. Check out this short demo:</p>

<p>As players progress through the levels of the game, they will <strong>occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait a non-trivial amount of time or make an in-app purchase to progress</strong>. In addition to driving in-app purchases, these gates serve the important purpose of giving players an enforced break from playing the game, hopefully resulting in that the player's enjoyment of the game being increased and prolonged.

## Objectives
    
In this project, we're going to analyze an AB-test where we moved the first gate in Cookie Cats from level 30 to level 40. In particular, we will look at the impact on player retention.


## Data
<p>The data we have is from 90,189 players that installed the game while the AB-test was running. The variables are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>userid</code> - a unique number that identifies each player.</li>
<li><code>version</code> - whether the player was put in the control group (<code>gate_30</code> - a gate at level 30) or the group with the moved gate (<code>gate_40</code> - a gate at level 40).</li>
<li><code>sum_gamerounds</code> - the number of game rounds played by the player during the first 14 days after install.</li>
<li><code>retention_1</code> - did the player come back and play <strong>1 day</strong> after installing?</li>
<li><code>retention_7</code> - did the player come back and play <strong>7 days</strong> after installing?</li>
</ul>
<p>When a player installed the game, he or she was randomly assigned to either <code>gate_30</code> or <code>gate_40</code>.</p>

# Look summary stats and plots
**The number of users reached gate 30 and gate 40 levels**
* 7% of the users reached level 30 
* 5% of the users reached level 40

**The number of users decreases as the levels progress**

- Most of users played the game at early stage and they didn't progress.
- Tactile Entertainment should learn why users churn playing the game.
- Doing research and collecting data about the game and users would help to understand user churn
- The difficulty of the game can be measured
- Gifts might help player retention

# Apply hypothesis testing and check assumptions
###Â Assumptions:
- Check normality
- If Normal Distribution, check homogeneity

### Steps:
- Split & Define Control Group & Test Group
- Apply Shapiro Test for normality
- If parametric apply Levene Test for homogeneity of variances
- If Parametric + homogeneity of variances apply T-Test
- If Parametric - homogeneity of variances apply Welch Test
- If Non-parametric apply Mann Whitney U Test directly

# Conclusion

Firstly, we investigated relationships and structures in the data. There was no missing value problem but was one outlier problem in the data. Summary stats and plots help us to understand the data and problem.

After applying A/B Testing, the analysis result gives us some important information. Shapiro Testing rejected H0 for Normality assumption. Therefore we needed to apply a Non-parametric test as called Mann Whitney U to compare two groups. As a result, Mann Whitney U Testing rejected H0 hypothesis and we learned that the mean of group B is significant less or equal to group A. 

Therefore, we can conclude that to not move the first gate from level 30 to level 40 for game rounds.
